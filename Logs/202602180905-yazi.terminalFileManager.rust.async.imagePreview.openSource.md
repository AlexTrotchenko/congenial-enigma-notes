# Yazi - Blazing Fast Terminal File Manager

## Overview

Yazi (means "duck" in Chinese) is a terminal file manager written in Rust, built on non-blocking async I/O. It provides an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience with full asynchronous support, image previews in terminal, a Lua plugin system, and Vim-like keybindings. Currently in public beta but usable as a daily driver.

## Core Features

- **Full async I/O** — all operations are non-blocking, CPU tasks spread across threads
- **Image preview** — built-in support for Kitty, iTerm2, Sixel, and more terminal protocols
- **Code highlighting** — built-in syntax highlighting with pre-loading for fast display
- **Lua plugin system** — UI plugins, custom previewers, preloaders, fetchers
- **Virtual filesystem** — remote file management, custom search engines, SFTP support
- **Data Distribution Service** — client-server architecture for cross-instance communication
- **Package manager** — install plugins and themes with one command (`ya pack`)
- **Tool integrations** — ripgrep, fd, fzf, zoxide
- **Vim-like UI** — input, pick, confirm, which, notify components; path auto-completion
- **Multi-tab support** — cross-directory selection, scrollable previews
- **Bulk operations** — bulk rename, archive extraction, visual mode
- **Git integration** — via plugin
- **Theme system** — customizable layouts, mouse support, trash bin

## Notes & Considerations

Yazi is in heavy development — expect breaking changes between versions. The async architecture makes it noticeably faster than traditional file managers like ranger or lf. The Lua plugin system allows extensive customization without recompiling. Popular alternatives: ranger (Python), lf (Go), nnn (C), broot (Rust). Yazi differentiates with its async design and built-in image preview support across many terminal protocols. 32.8k GitHub stars indicates strong community adoption.
