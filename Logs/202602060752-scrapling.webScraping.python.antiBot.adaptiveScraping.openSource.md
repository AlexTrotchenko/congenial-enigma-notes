# Scrapling - Adaptive Web Scraping Library That Survives Website Changes

## Overview

Scrapling is a high-performance Python web scraping library that features adaptive element tracking — it can automatically relocate elements after website structure changes using intelligent similarity algorithms. It includes multiple fetchers (HTTP, stealth, dynamic/browser), anti-bot bypass capabilities (including Cloudflare Turnstile), and an MCP server for AI-assisted scraping. Built by web scrapers for web scrapers, it's blazingly fast and outperforms most Python scraping libraries.

## Core Features

- **Adaptive element tracking** — automatically relocate elements after website redesigns using `auto_save=True` and `adaptive=True`
- **Multiple fetchers** — `Fetcher` (fast HTTP), `StealthyFetcher` (anti-bot bypass), `DynamicFetcher` (full browser automation via Playwright)
- **Anti-bot bypass** — TLS fingerprint impersonation, stealth headers, Cloudflare Turnstile/Interstitial bypass
- **Session management** — persistent sessions with `FetcherSession`, `StealthySession`, `DynamicSession` for cookies and state
- **Full async support** — async versions of all fetchers and sessions
- **MCP server for AI** — built-in MCP server for Claude/Cursor to extract targeted content, reducing token usage
- **Interactive shell** — IPython-based scraping shell with curl-to-Scrapling conversion
- **CLI extraction** — scrape URLs directly from terminal without code (`scrapling extract`)
- **BeautifulSoup-compatible API** — familiar methods like `find_all()`, plus CSS selectors, XPath, text search, regex
- **Lightning fast** — outperforms BS4 by ~775x, PyQuery by ~11x, Selectolax by ~40x in benchmarks
- **Find similar elements** — automatically locate elements similar to found elements

## Quick Start Guide

1. Install base library: `pip install scrapling`
2. Install fetchers and browsers:
   ```bash
   pip install "scrapling[fetchers]"
   scrapling install  # Downloads browsers + dependencies
   ```
3. Basic usage:
   ```python
   from scrapling.fetchers import Fetcher, StealthyFetcher
   
   # Simple HTTP request
   page = Fetcher.get('https://quotes.toscrape.com/')
   quotes = page.css('.quote .text::text')
   
   # Stealth mode with Cloudflare bypass
   page = StealthyFetcher.fetch('https://example.com', headless=True, solve_cloudflare=True)
   ```
4. CLI extraction: `scrapling extract get 'https://example.com' content.md`
5. Interactive shell: `scrapling shell`

## Use Cases

- **Scraping anti-bot protected sites** — bypass Cloudflare, fingerprint detection, and other protections
- **Resilient scrapers** — adaptive selectors survive website redesigns without code changes
- **AI-assisted extraction** — MCP server integration with Claude/Cursor for intelligent data extraction
- **High-volume scraping** — session management and async support for efficient large-scale scraping
- **Quick data extraction** — CLI commands for one-off extractions without writing code
- **Dynamic content** — full browser automation for JavaScript-rendered pages

## Technical Details

- **Pricing Model:** Free and open-source (MIT license)
- **Platform Support:** Python 3.10+, all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux). Docker image available
- **Integration Options:** MCP server for AI agents, BeautifulSoup-like API, Scrapy/Parsel pseudo-elements, full type hints
- **Data Export:** Text, Markdown, or HTML via CLI; programmatic access to all element data
- **Dependencies:** Optional extras: `[fetchers]` for browser automation, `[ai]` for MCP server, `[shell]` for interactive shell, `[all]` for everything
- **Performance:** ~2ms for 5000 nested elements text extraction (775x faster than BS4)

## Notes & Considerations

The adaptive scraping feature works by saving element signatures with `auto_save=True`, then using `adaptive=True` on subsequent requests to relocate elements even if the DOM structure changed. 92% test coverage and full type hints. Starting with v0.3.2, the base install only includes the parser — fetchers and browsers require additional install steps. The library is for educational purposes; users are responsible for complying with website terms of service. Translations available in Arabic, Spanish, German, Chinese, Japanese, and Russian.
