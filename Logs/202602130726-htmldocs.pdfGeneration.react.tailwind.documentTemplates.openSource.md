# htmldocs - The Modern Alternative to LaTeX

## Overview

htmldocs is a modern document generation toolkit that lets you create PDF document templates using React, JSX, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a local document editor and preview server, offering all the structural benefits of LaTeX with the familiarity of HTML and CSS. Build dynamic templates (invoices, reports, contracts) and generate PDFs by passing data as props. Built on Chromium's rendering engine with Paged.js for advanced layout features.

## Core Features

- **React/JSX templating** — build document templates as React components with props
- **Full TypeScript support** — type-safe document generation
- **Tailwind CSS styling** — use the CSS framework you already know
- **Real-time preview server** — hot reloading during development
- **Modern CSS features** — margin boxes, flexbox, and latest CSS via Chromium
- **Unstyled component library** — Document, Page, Footer, MarginBox, Spacer, Head
- **Dynamic data integration** — pass props and fetch from APIs
- **Version control friendly** — documents are code, works with Git
- **CI/CD integration** — automate PDF generation in pipelines

## Quick Start Guide

1. Create a new project:
   ```bash
   npx htmldocs@latest init
   ```
2. Build your document template as a React component:
   ```jsx
   <Invoice
     customer={{
       name: "John Doe",
       address: "456 Main St",
       city: "Anytown",
       state: "CA",
       zip: "12345",
       phone: "123-456-7890",
     }}
     items={items}
   />
   ```
3. Preview with hot reload during development
4. Generate PDFs by passing different props

## Available Components

- **Document** — root wrapper for PDF documents
- **Head** — metadata and styles
- **Page** — individual pages with sizing options
- **Footer** — page footers with page numbers
- **MarginBox** — CSS margin boxes for headers/footers
- **Spacer** — layout spacing utilities

## Use Cases

- **Invoices & receipts** — dynamic billing documents from order data
- **Reports** — generate reports from analytics/database
- **Contracts** — template legal documents with variable fields
- **Certificates** — automated certificate generation
- **Proposals** — sales/project proposals with dynamic content
- **Any templated PDF** — if it's a document with variable data, htmldocs can generate it

## Notes & Considerations

htmldocs positions itself as "bringing document generation into 2025" — the React/TypeScript approach means frontend developers can create documents without learning LaTeX or fighting with Word. The Chromium rendering engine ensures full CSS support (unlike many PDF tools that only support CSS subsets). Paged.js handles pagination edge cases. Good fit for teams already using React who need programmatic PDF generation. The MIT license is business-friendly for commercial use.
