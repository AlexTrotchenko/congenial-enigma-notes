## Notes & Considerations

⚠️ **Beta software** — backup your system before applying tweaks. The repo version may be newer than the latest release with unreleased features and potential bugs. The app wraps PowerShell scripts in a user-friendly GUI, making Windows optimization accessible to non-technical users. Backup/revert functionality provides a safety net for experimental tweaks.
