# Professional Programming - Curated Learning Resources for Software Engineers

## Overview
Professional Programming is a comprehensive, opinionated collection of full-stack learning resources designed to make developers more proficient. Maintained by Charles-Axel Dein (charlax), it features carefully selected articles, books, talks, and tools that have proven to be truly inspiring or have become timeless classics in software engineering. The collection emphasizes quality over quantity, avoiding overwhelming readers while covering topics from algorithms to career growth.

## Core Features
- Curated must-read books including "The Pragmatic Programmer," "Clean Code," and "Release It!" with brief explanations of their value
- Over 90+ topic categories covering the full spectrum of software engineering from algorithms to work-life balance
- Visual content indicators (🧰 resource lists, 📖 books, 🎞 videos/talks, 🏙 presentations, ⭐️ must-reads, 📃 papers)
- Key takeaways extracted from articles to enable quick scanning and decision-making
- Links to related curated lists including engineering-management and python-education repositories
- Regular updates with community contributions via pull requests

## Quick Start Guide
1. Visit the repository at https://github.com/charlax/professional-programming
2. Read the "Must-read articles" section for foundational wisdom like "On Being A Senior Engineer" and "Lessons Learned in Software Development"
3. Browse the topic index to find areas relevant to your current learning goals
4. Star/bookmark the repository for future reference
5. Use the visual indicators to prioritize content type (videos vs books vs articles)
6. Contribute back by opening PRs for resources you've found valuable

## Use Cases
- Onboarding new developers with curated reading lists organized by topic
- Self-directed learning for career advancement and skill development
- Interview preparation using the dedicated interviewing section with system design resources
- Building a personal learning curriculum with high-quality, vetted resources
- Team knowledge sharing by referencing specific sections in discussions
- Discovering timeless engineering principles and avoiding common antipatterns

## Technical Details
- **Pricing Model**: Completely free and open source (MIT License implied by GitHub defaults)
- **Platform Support**: Web-based GitHub repository, accessible from any browser or device
- **Integration Options**: Can be forked, starred, or used as a reading list; integrates with GitHub's features like Issues and PRs for contributions
- **Data Export**: Markdown format allows easy copying, forking, and offline reading

## Notes & Considerations
The collection is intentionally opinionated and not comprehensive—the maintainer explicitly states they won't add everything to keep the list concise. Some resources may require paid access (books on Amazon, paid courses), though many free alternatives are included. The author notes they don't necessarily endorse every single line in the referenced resources or everything the authors have said. Best used as a starting point for deeper exploration rather than a complete curriculum. The repository is particularly strong on foundational topics like design patterns, career growth, and software architecture, with extensive coverage of both technical and soft skills. Consider combining with hands-on practice through the "Exercises" section which includes build-your-own-x projects and coding challenges.
