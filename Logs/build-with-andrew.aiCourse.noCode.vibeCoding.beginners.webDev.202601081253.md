# Build with Andrew - Learn to Build Apps with AI in 30 Minutes

## Overview
Build with Andrew is an introductory course taught by Andrew Ng that teaches complete beginners how to build working web applications by describing ideas in plain English and letting AI transform them into functional apps. In under 30 minutes, learners with zero coding experience can create, customize, and share interactive web applications through AI-assisted "vibe coding" techniques.

## Core Features
- No-code app development through natural language prompting with AI tools
- Hands-on project-based learning with immediate, shareable results
- Repeatable framework applicable to any application idea (games, tools, utilities)
- Step-by-step troubleshooting methodology for AI-generated code
- Customization techniques for UI elements like inputs, buttons, and color schemes
- Certificate of completion included

## Quick Start Guide
1. Visit DeepLearning.AI and enroll in the "Build with Andrew" course
2. No prerequisites required - course assumes zero coding or AI knowledge
