## Notes & Considerations
Attribution is appreciated but not required under the MIT license. Direct pull requests to the GitHub repository are not accepted; contributions must be submitted through the Uiverse.io website where they undergo review before being added to the galaxy. The GitHub repo serves as an archive while the main browsing experience is on uiverse.io. Elements use no external dependencies, making them lightweight and easy to integrate. The large variety (4000+ components) may require time to find the perfect element, so using the search and filter features on the website is recommended over browsing GitHub directly.
