# Magic UI - Animated React Components for Design Engineers

## Overview
Magic UI is a free and open-source UI library offering 150+ animated components and visual effects built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. Designed specifically for design engineers, it follows a copy-paste philosophy similar to shadcn/ui, giving developers full code ownership without external dependencies. Perfect for creating eye-catching landing pages, marketing sites, and applications that need professional animations.

## Core Features
- 150+ animated components including text effects, backgrounds, buttons, and special effects
- Copy-paste installation with full code ownership (no npm package dependencies)
- Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion
- Perfect companion for shadcn/ui with identical installation process
- Device mockups (Safari, iPhone, Android) for product showcases
- Community-contributed components with active development
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) support for AI-assisted development

## Quick Start Guide
1. Initialize shadcn in your Next.js project: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init`
2. Add any Magic UI component: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @magicui/globe`
3. Import the component in your file: `import { Globe } from "@/components/ui/globe"`
4. Use the component in your JSX: `<Globe />`
5. Customize the component code directly in your `components/ui` folder

## Use Cases
- Building animated landing pages and marketing websites
- Creating SaaS product pages with engaging visual effects
- Adding text animations (typing, morphing, gradient, sparkles) to hero sections
- Implementing background effects (particles, grids, ripples) for visual depth
- Showcasing products with device mockups (Safari, iPhone, Android frames)
- Building interactive UI elements with hover effects and transitions

## Technical Details
- **Pricing Model**: Free open-source library; Magic UI Pro at $199 one-time for 8 templates + 50 premium components
- **Platform Support**: Web (React/Next.js applications)
- **Integration Options**: Works with shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion; same CLI as shadcn
- **Data Export**: Full source code ownership—components live in your codebase

## Notes & Considerations
Requires existing React/Next.js project setup with Tailwind CSS configured. Some components depend on shadcn/ui base components (Switch, Button). The library has 19.6k+ GitHub stars and MIT license, indicating strong community adoption. Pro version includes production-ready templates (AI Agent, Dev Tool, Mobile, SaaS, Startup, Portfolio, Changelog, Blog) for faster development. Components are highly customizable since you own the source code directly.
