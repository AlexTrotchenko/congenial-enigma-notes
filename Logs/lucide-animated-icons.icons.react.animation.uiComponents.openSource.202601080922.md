# Lucide Animated Icons - Beautifully Crafted Animated React Icons

## Overview
Lucide Animated is an open-source collection of 300+ smooth animated icons built for React projects. Created using Motion (Framer Motion) and based on the popular Lucide icon set, these icons provide polished micro-interactions that can be easily integrated via the shadcn/ui CLI. Perfect for developers who want to add delightful animated touches to their web applications without building animations from scratch.

## Core Features
- 300+ beautifully animated icons with smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- Built with Motion (Framer Motion) for performant, customizable animations
- shadcn/ui CLI integration for easy copy-paste installation of individual icons
- Full TypeScript support with properly typed React components
- Based on Lucide icon design language for consistency with existing icon sets
- MIT licensed for free use in personal and commercial projects

## Quick Start Guide
1. Ensure you have a React/Next.js project with shadcn/ui configured
2. Install individual icons using the CLI: `pnpm dlx shadcn add @lucide-animated/<icon-name>`
3. Alternative package managers: `npx shadcn add`, `yarn dlx shadcn add`, or `bunx shadcn add`
4. Import the icon component in your file: `import { IconName } from '@/components/icons/icon-name'`
5. Use the icon in your JSX with any standard React props
6. Browse available icons at lucide-animated.com and use `⌘F` to search

## Notes & Considerations
Project is actively maintained with 45+ contributors and 6k+ GitHub stars. Icons cannot be redistributed or resold as a collection, but individual use in projects is permitted. The library is a work in progress with continuous expansion. Requires familiarity with React and ideally shadcn/ui for the smoothest integration experience. For custom animations or modifications, knowledge of Framer Motion/Motion library is helpful.
