# Kimi Code CLI - AI Coding Agent for the Terminal

## Overview

Kimi Code CLI is an AI agent from Moonshot AI that runs in the terminal, helping with software development tasks and terminal operations. It can read and edit code, execute shell commands, search and fetch web pages, and autonomously plan and adjust actions during execution. Beyond just a coding assistant, it doubles as a shell replacement with AI capabilities and integrates with popular IDEs via multiple protocols.

## Core Features

- **Terminal AI agent** — chat-based coding assistant that runs in your terminal
- **Code editing** — read, write, and modify code files with AI assistance
- **Shell command execution** — run commands directly, acts as both agent and shell
- **Shell command mode** — press Ctrl-X to toggle shell mode without leaving the CLI
- **Web search & fetch** — search and retrieve web content for context
- **Autonomous planning** — plans and adjusts actions during task execution
- **VS Code extension** — official extension for Visual Studio Code integration
- **ACP support** — Agent Client Protocol for Zed, JetBrains, and other compatible IDEs
- **MCP support** — Model Context Protocol for connecting external tools and services
- **Zsh integration** — plugin for AI-powered shell experience (Ctrl-X to switch to agent mode)

## Quick Start Guide

1. Install via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install kimi-cli
   ```
2. Run and login:
   ```bash
   kimi
   /login
   ```
3. Start using — ask it to edit code, run commands, search the web
4. Toggle shell mode with Ctrl-X to run commands directly
5. Optional: Install VS Code extension or configure ACP for IDE integration

## IDE Integration

**VS Code:**
- Install [Kimi Code VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=moonshot-ai.kimi-code)

**Zed / JetBrains (via ACP):**
```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Kimi Code CLI": {
      "command": "kimi",
      "args": ["acp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

**Zsh Plugin:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MoonshotAI/zsh-kimi-cli.git \
  ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/kimi-cli
# Add kimi-cli to plugins in ~/.zshrc
```

## MCP Configuration

```bash
# Add HTTP MCP server
kimi mcp add --transport http context7 https://mcp.context7.com/mcp

# Add stdio MCP server
kimi mcp add --transport stdio chrome-devtools -- npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest

# List/remove servers
kimi mcp list
kimi mcp remove chrome-devtools
```

Or use config file: `kimi --mcp-config-file /path/to/mcp.json`

## Use Cases

- **Coding assistant** — get AI help while staying in the terminal
- **Shell replacement** — use as your daily shell with AI superpowers
- **IDE integration** — bring Kimi agent into VS Code, Zed, or JetBrains
- **Automated tasks** — let the agent plan and execute multi-step development tasks
- **Tool extension** — connect MCP servers for additional capabilities

## Technical Details

- **Pricing Model:** Free and open-source
- **Platform Support:** Python package, cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- **Protocols:** ACP (Agent Client Protocol), MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- **IDE Support:** VS Code (extension), Zed, JetBrains (via ACP)
- **Shell Support:** Zsh integration plugin available
- **Limitations:** Built-in shell commands like `cd` not yet supported in shell mode

## Notes & Considerations

Moonshot AI is a Chinese AI company (Kimi is their flagship model). The CLI supports both ACP and MCP protocols, making it highly interoperable with the emerging agent ecosystem. The dual shell/agent mode is clever — Ctrl-X toggles between AI chat and direct shell execution. Similar in concept to Claude Code, Aider, or Cursor but with strong protocol support for IDE integration. Note that it requires authentication via `/login` command before use.
