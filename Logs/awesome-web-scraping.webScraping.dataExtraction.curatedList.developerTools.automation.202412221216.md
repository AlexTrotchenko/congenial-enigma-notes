## Notes & Considerations
This is a curated list rather than a standalone tool, so quality and maintenance of linked projects varies. Some referenced tools may be deprecated or unmaintained. Always verify the last commit date and issue activity on individual project repositories before adoption. The list focuses on open-source solutions but also includes commercial services like captcha solvers and proxy providers. For headless browser options, the repo links to the complementary dhamaniasad/HeadlessBrowsers list which provides more comprehensive coverage.
