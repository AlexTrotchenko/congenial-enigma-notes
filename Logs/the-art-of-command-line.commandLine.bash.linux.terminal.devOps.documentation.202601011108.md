# The Art of Command Line - Master the Terminal in One Page

## Overview
The Art of Command Line is a comprehensive, community-curated guide to mastering command-line proficiency on Unix-like systems. Designed for both beginners and experienced users, it compiles essential tips, commands, and best practices into a single, well-organized reference document. With 159k+ GitHub stars and translations in 17 languages, it has become the de facto resource for developers looking to improve their terminal fluency.

## Core Features
- Comprehensive coverage from basics to advanced techniques organized by use case (everyday use, file processing, system debugging)
- Platform-specific sections for Linux, macOS, and Windows with tailored commands and workflows
- Practical one-liner examples demonstrating powerful command combinations for real-world tasks
- Curated list of "obscure but useful" commands that solve specific problems efficiently
- Cross-platform installation guidance using apt, yum, brew, and other package managers
- Community-maintained with 161+ contributors ensuring accuracy and relevance

## Quick Start Guide
1. Visit the GitHub repository at https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line
2. Start with the "Basics" section to learn fundamental concepts like `man`, `ssh`, and file management
3. Install a text-based editor (nano for beginners, vim/emacs for power users)
4. Practice the "Everyday use" commands including Tab completion, Ctrl-r history search, and job management
5. Bookmark the page for reference and explore sections relevant to your current tasks
6. Use the helper site Explainshell.com to understand complex command pipelines

## Use Cases
- Quickly referencing forgotten command syntax during development work
- Onboarding new developers to terminal proficiency at organizations
- Learning efficient text processing with awk, sed, grep, and jq
- Debugging system issues using strace, lsof, and /proc filesystem
- Improving productivity with keyboard shortcuts and shell customizations
- Building shell scripts with proper error handling and best practices

## Technical Details
- **Pricing Model**: Completely free and open source under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License
- **Platform Support**: Primary focus on Linux/Bash; dedicated sections for macOS (brew, BSD differences) and Windows (WSL, Cygwin, MinGW)
- **Integration Options**: Works with any terminal emulator; complements tools like tmux, screen, and ssh
- **Data Export**: Plain Markdown format; easily cloned, forked, or downloaded for offline use

## Notes & Considerations
This is a reference guide, not installable software—value comes from reading, practicing, and bookmarking for quick lookups. Some commands require package installation (e.g., jq, ripgrep, htop) via your system's package manager. The macOS section notes important BSD vs GNU command differences that can cause subtle script incompatibilities. Windows users should install WSL, Cygwin, or MinGW first to access Unix tools. The guide assumes basic familiarity with using a terminal; complete beginners may want supplementary tutorials before diving deep.
