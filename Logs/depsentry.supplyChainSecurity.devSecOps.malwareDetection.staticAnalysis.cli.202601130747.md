# DepSentry - Blazing Fast Supply Chain Security Scanner

## Overview
DepSentry is a high-performance supply chain security tool written in Rust, designed for Blue Teams and DevSecOps workflows. Unlike standard dependency auditors that only check for CVEs, it acts as a proactive middleware that analyzes packages for malware, obfuscation, and reputation issues before installation. The tool supports both NPM and PyPI ecosystems with ephemeral sandboxing to ensure zero footprint analysis.

## Core Features
- **Hybrid Analysis Engine**: Combines CVE scanning (Google OSV database), malware heuristics detection (eval, exec, shell injection, hardcoded IPs), and Shannon entropy analysis for identifying obfuscated/packed code
- **Ephemeral Sandboxing**: Downloads and extracts packages to isolated temporary directories with zero footprint—malicious code is never executed on the host machine
- **High Performance**: Built in Rust with parallel processing via Rayon and Tokio, utilizing all CPU cores for simultaneous file analysis
- **Typosquatting Detection**: Warns when package names mimic popular libraries (e.g., `react` vs `reacct`)
- **Reputation Checking**: Flags dangerously new packages (< 7 days old) as potential threats
- **Zip Slip Protection**: Prevents path traversal attacks during package extraction

## Quick Start Guide
1. Download the appropriate binary from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/swek09/depsentry/releases) for your OS
2. **Windows**: Run `DepSentry-Installer-x64.msi` (auto-adds to PATH)
3. **Ubuntu/Debian**: Install with `sudo dpkg -i DepSentry-Linux-x64.deb`
4. **Linux (Other)**: Extract `DepSentry-Linux-x64.tar.gz` and move binary to `/usr/local/bin`
5. Check a single package: `depsentry check axios`
6. Scan entire project manifest: `depsentry scan` (runs in current directory)

## Use Cases
- **Pre-installation vetting**: Analyze remote packages before adding to projects
- **CI/CD Quality Gate**: Integrate `depsentry scan` into pipelines to audit `package.json` manifests
- **Supply chain attack prevention**: Detect typosquatting attempts and malicious dependencies
- **Malware hunting**: Identify high-entropy payloads and obfuscated code in npm/PyPI packages
- **Blue Team operations**: Proactive defense against dependency-based attacks

## Technical Details
- **Pricing Model**: Free and open source (Apache License 2.0)
- **Platform Support**: Windows (MSI installer), Linux (DEB package, tarball), macOS (build from source)
- **Supported Ecosystems**: NPM (package.json) and PyPI packages
- **Integration Options**: CLI-based, designed for CI/CD pipeline integration
- **Data Sources**: Google OSV database for CVE data, real-time heuristic analysis
- **Current Version**: v0.1.2

## Notes & Considerations
DepSentry is relatively new (released January 2026) and under active development. Building from source requires Rust and Cargo to be installed. The tool currently supports NPM and PyPI ecosystems—other package managers are not yet supported. Risk scores are calculated on a 0-100 scale with severity categorization (CRITICAL, HIGH, etc.). Entropy threshold for detecting obfuscated code is set at Shannon Entropy > 7.5. The tool is designed as a security layer, not a replacement for existing dependency management tools.
