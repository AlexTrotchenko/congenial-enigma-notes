# Lan Mouse - Cross-Platform Mouse & Keyboard Sharing via LAN

## Overview

Lan Mouse is a cross-platform software KVM switch that lets you control multiple PCs with a single mouse and keyboard over your local network. Written in Rust, it's an open-source alternative to Synergy, ShareMouse, and Deskflow, with encrypted traffic via DTLS (WebRTC). It features a GTK frontend, CLI, and daemon mode, supporting Linux (GNOME, KDE, Sway, Hyprland), Windows, and macOS.

## Core Features

- **Cross-platform mouse/keyboard sharing** — seamlessly move your cursor between multiple computers over LAN
- **DTLS encryption** — all network traffic encrypted via WebRTC's DTLS implementation
- **GTK + libadwaita frontend** — modern graphical interface for easy device management
- **Multiple backend support** — wlroots, libei, xdg remote-desktop portal, X11, Windows, and macOS backends
- **CLI and daemon mode** — run headless as a systemd service or control via command line
- **Configurable positioning** — place clients on left, right, top, or bottom edges
- **Auto-discovery and fingerprint auth** — authorize devices via TLS certificate fingerprints
- **Proof-of-concept mobile app** — Android/iOS remote control via community project

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Install:**
   - Arch: `pacman -S lan-mouse`
   - Fedora: `dnf install lan-mouse` (via Terra repo)
   - macOS: Download from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/feschber/lan-mouse/releases), unzip, remove quarantine with `xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "Lan Mouse.app"`, grant accessibility permissions
   - Windows: Download from releases, extract zip (dependencies included)
   - From source: `cargo install lan-mouse`
2. Launch `lan-mouse` — the GTK frontend opens by default
3. Click **Add** and enter the hostname of the remote device
4. On the remote device, authorize your local device using the fingerprint under "Incoming Connections"
5. Make sure UDP port **4242** is open in your firewall

## Use Cases

- **Multi-PC workflow** — developers or designers working across multiple machines with one keyboard and mouse
- **Mixed OS environments** — share input between Linux, macOS, and Windows machines seamlessly
- **KVM replacement** — software alternative to hardware KVM switches without cable clutter
- **Home lab management** — control multiple servers/desktops from a single workstation
- **Presentation setups** — control multiple display computers from one input device

## Technical Details

- **Pricing Model:** Free and open-source (GPL-3.0)
- **Platform Support:** Linux (GNOME ≥45, KDE Plasma ≥6.1, wlroots/Sway ≥1.8, Hyprland, Wayfire), Windows, macOS. X11 input capture is WIP
- **Integration Options:** TOML config file, CLI interface, systemd service, configurable port (default 4242/UDP)
- **Data Export:** N/A
- **Dependencies:** GTK4 + libadwaita for GUI. macOS needs brew packages (libadwaita, pkg-config, imagemagick). Windows needs GTK built via gvsbuild
- **Language:** Rust

- [Arch Linux Package](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/lan-mouse/)

## Notes & Considerations

X11 currently only supports input emulation (receiving end), not capture (sending end). On Windows, the mouse cursor will be invisible when receiving input if no physical mouse is connected. Sway/wlroots compositors without libei may have issues with modifier keys (Ctrl/Shift/Alt). Wayfire users need to add `shortcuts-inhibit` to their plugin list. macOS requires accessibility permissions to be granted. Clipboard support and latency/bandwidth visualization are on the roadmap but not yet implemented. The release bind (keys to release the mouse back to the local machine) defaults to A+S+D+F and is configurable.
