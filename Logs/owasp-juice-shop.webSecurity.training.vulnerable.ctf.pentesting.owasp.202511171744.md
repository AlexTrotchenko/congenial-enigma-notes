## Notes & Considerations
This is an intentionally vulnerable application - never deploy it to production or internet-facing environments without proper isolation. The demo instance at demo.owasp-juice.shop is for preview only, not for hacking practice. For learning, always deploy your own local or isolated instance. The companion guide "Pwning OWASP Juice Shop" is available free under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license and provides complete solutions to all challenges. Official Docker images are provided for both stable releases (latest) and development snapshots. The application requires 64-bit Node.js and includes binaries for sqlite3 and libxmljs2 in packaged distributions.
