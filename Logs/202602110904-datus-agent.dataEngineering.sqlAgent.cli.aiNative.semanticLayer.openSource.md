# Datus Agent - AI-Native Data Engineering CLI

## Overview

Datus is an open-source data engineering agent that builds evolvable context for your data system. Described as "Claude Code for data engineers," it provides an AI-powered CLI for writing SQL, building domain-specific subagents, and constructing semantic context interactively. The platform shifts data engineering from "building tables and pipelines" to "delivering scoped, domain-aware agents for analysts and business users."

## Core Features

- **Datus-CLI** — AI-powered command-line interface for data engineers to chat with databases, write SQL, and build context
- **Contextual data engineering** — automatically builds a living semantic map combining metadata, metrics, reference SQL, and external knowledge
- **Domain subagents** — create scoped chatbots for specific business domains, each with its own context, tools, and rules
- **Datus-Chat** — web chatbot for analysts with multi-turn conversations and built-in feedback (upvotes, issue reports)
- **Datus-API** — APIs for other agents or applications needing stable, accurate data services
- **Continuous learning loop** — learns from success stories and user corrections to evolve reasoning accuracy over time
- **Semantic model generation** — auto-generate and refine semantic models from SQL history

## Quick Start Guide

1. Install (requires Python >= 3.12):
   ```bash
   pip install datus-agent==0.2.1
   datus-agent init
   ```
2. Start chatting with your database:
   ```bash
   datus-cli --namespace demo
   /Check the top 10 bank by assets lost @Table duckdb-demo.main.bank_failures
   ```
3. Build semantic context with `/gen_semantic_model`
4. Create a domain subagent: `.subagent add mychatbot`
5. Deploy to web interface: `http://localhost:8501/?subagent=mychatbot`
6. Iterate based on analyst feedback

## Use Cases

- **Data exploration** — chat with databases using natural language, test joins, refine prompts
- **Semantic layer building** — create living documentation of your data with AI assistance
- **Domain-specific data access** — build scoped subagents for sales, finance, marketing, etc.
- **Self-service analytics** — give analysts a chatbot that understands their specific data domain
- **Data governance** — control what data each subagent can access with explicit rules and scope limits
- **Knowledge capture** — turn tribal SQL knowledge into reusable, documented context

## Technical Details

- **Pricing Model:** Free and open-source
- **Platform Support:** Python 3.12+, cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- **Integration Options:** CLI for engineers, web chatbot for analysts, API for other systems
- **Database Support:** Works with various databases (example shows DuckDB)
- **Architecture:** Three components — CLI (engineers), Chat (analysts), API (systems)

## Notes & Considerations

The workflow follows a clear progression: (1) explore data via chat, (2) build semantic context, (3) create domain subagents, (4) deploy to analysts, (5) iterate on feedback. The "subagent" concept is interesting — each domain gets its own scoped assistant with limited table access and specific rules, making data access safer and more accurate. The continuous learning loop means the system improves over time as users provide feedback on query results. Positioned similarly to how Claude Code works for developers, but specifically for data engineering workflows.
