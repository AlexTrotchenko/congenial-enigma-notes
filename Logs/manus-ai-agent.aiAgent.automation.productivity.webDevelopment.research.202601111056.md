# Manus AI - Autonomous AI Agent for End-to-End Task Execution

## Overview
Manus AI is a general-purpose autonomous AI agent that goes beyond conversational AI to independently plan, execute, and deliver complete work products. Unlike traditional chatbots, Manus operates within a dedicated virtual machine sandbox with internet access, persistent file storage, and the ability to install software—enabling it to research, build, and automate complex workflows with minimal human intervention. The platform achieved $100M ARR within eight months of launch, making it the fastest startup to reach this milestone globally.

## Core Features
- **Autonomous Task Execution**: Takes high-level objectives and independently performs necessary actions to deliver completed results without ongoing guidance
- **Virtual Machine Sandbox**: Each session runs in a dedicated cloud-based VM with internet access, file system, and software installation capabilities
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Utilizes specialized AI agents working together for web browsing, data analysis, code writing, and research
- **Wide Research**: Parallel multi-agent research capability that orchestrates multiple Manus instances for comprehensive analysis
- **Full-Stack Web Development**: Build and deploy production-ready web apps with backends, databases, authentication, and AI features through conversation
- **Browser Operator Extension**: Connect to your local browser to automate tasks within authenticated platforms and premium services
- **Real-Time Transparency**: "Manus's Computer" dashboard streams AI actions live, allowing mid-task intervention and redirection
- **Document Generation**: Creates editable PPTX presentations, PDFs, spreadsheets, images, and websites

## Quick Start Guide
1. Visit https://manus.im and sign up for an account (currently operating with invite codes for beta)
2. Access the dashboard and familiarize yourself with the chat interface
3. Start with a simple task prompt like "Create a professional resume for [role]" to understand the workflow
4. Watch the live execution in "Manus's Computer" view to see the agent's actions
5. For complex tasks, use the Quality mode; for quick turnarounds, select Speed mode
6. Download generated files from the Library or deploy web apps directly
7. Install the Browser Operator extension to automate tasks in authenticated platforms

## Use Cases
- **Research & Analysis**: Deep market research, competitor analysis, financial modeling, data synthesis across multiple sources
- **Web Development**: Building full-stack applications, landing pages, internal tools, and web apps with backend infrastructure
- **Document Creation**: Professional presentations, reports, resumes, proposals, and localized content
- **Data Processing**: Cleaning raw data, generating structured outputs, creating automated reports and spreadsheets
- **Travel & Planning**: Complex trip planning with itineraries, budget optimization, and logistics coordination
- **Workflow Automation**: Calendar reminders, email management via Mail Manus, Slack integration for team productivity
- **Mobile App Development**: End-to-end mobile application creation (introduced in v1.6)

## Technical Details
- **Pricing Model**: Credit-based system with multiple tiers:
  - Free: 300 daily credits, 1,000 starter credits, 1 concurrent task
  - Basic ($39/month): 3,900 credits, 2 concurrent tasks, 2 scheduled tasks
  - Pro ($199/month): 19,900 credits, 5 concurrent tasks, priority access
  - Team: Custom allocation, dedicated support, SLA guarantees
  - Add-on credit packs available (never expire)
- **Platform Support**: Web application, iOS mobile app
- **Integration Options**: Browser Operator extension, Slack Connector, Mail Manus, Google Calendar, API access
- **Data Export**: Editable PPTX, PDF, XLSX, DOCX, deployable websites, custom file formats

## Notes & Considerations
- **Beta Status**: Platform is still in beta with ongoing development; expect evolving features and occasional bugs
- **Credit Consumption**: Complex tasks consume more credits; a website build may use ~600 credits and take 40 minutes
- **Quality vs Speed**: Quality mode costs ~20% more but handles complex/nuanced tasks with greater precision
- **Meta Acquisition**: Manus has joined Meta, signaling potential integration with Meta's AI ecosystem
- **Learning Curve**: Manus Academy offers structured courses (Fundamentals, Intermediate, Advanced) plus domain-specific paths for Finance, Product Management, Business Analysis, and Marketing
- **Task Reliability**: While benchmark performance is impressive (SOTA on GAIA), reliability varies with task complexity—human intervention capability is a key feature
- **Background Execution**: Unlike chatbots, Manus can handle long-running tasks entirely in background without active connection
- **Scale**: Has processed 147+ trillion tokens and powered 80+ million virtual computers since launch
