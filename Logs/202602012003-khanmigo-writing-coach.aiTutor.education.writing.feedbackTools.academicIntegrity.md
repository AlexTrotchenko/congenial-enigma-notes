# Khanmigo Writing Coach - AI-Guided Essay Writing Without Shortcuts

## Overview

Khanmigo Writing Coach is an AI-powered writing tool by Khan Academy that guides students through the essay writing process — from outline to final draft — without ever writing a word for them. Designed by teachers, it provides step-by-step guidance for students and actionable insights for educators, emphasizing skill-building over AI-generated shortcuts. It's part of the broader Khanmigo AI tutor ecosystem.

## Core Features

- **Teacher insights dashboard** — monitor student progress with detailed writing process analytics, strengths, and areas for improvement
- **Built-in originality checks** — enhances academic integrity by detecting AI-generated or plagiarized content
- **Interactive feedback** — provides dynamic, real-time feedback during the writing process rather than just end-of-draft corrections
- **Integrated with Khan Academy content** — leverages Khan Academy's world-class educational content library
- **Safety-first AI design** — ethically designed with learning and student safety as top priorities

## Notes & Considerations

Currently only available to users in the United States with a U.S. billing address. Users under 18 require a parent or guardian to sign up and add them to the account. Unlike ChatGPT or other general AI tools, Writing Coach intentionally never writes content for students — it's designed purely as a guide. Rated 4 stars by Common Sense Media for AI learning tools. Khan Academy is a nonprofit, so subscription fees directly support the platform's educational mission.
