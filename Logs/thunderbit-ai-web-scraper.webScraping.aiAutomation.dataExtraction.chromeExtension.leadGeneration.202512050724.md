## Notes & Considerations

- Works only in Chrome browser as an extension; not available as standalone desktop application or API
- Credit-based system means costs scale with usage volume; heavy users should calculate costs carefully
- AI field suggestion quality depends on website structure; complex or heavily dynamic sites may require manual adjustments
- Pre-built templates provide best results for supported popular sites; custom sites rely on AI detection
- Because it runs in your browser session, it can access any page you're logged into, which is both a feature and a security consideration
- Chrome Store rating: 4.6 stars with strong user reviews for ease of use
