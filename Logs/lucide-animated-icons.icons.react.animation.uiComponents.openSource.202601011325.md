# Lucide Animated - Beautifully Crafted Animated Icons for React

## Overview
Lucide Animated is an open-source collection of smooth, beautifully animated icons built for React projects. Built on top of the popular Lucide icon set and powered by Motion (Framer Motion), it transforms static icons into polished micro-interactions that enhance user experience. The library is MIT licensed and actively maintained with 45+ contributors.

## Core Features
- 250+ animated icons with smooth, professional animations
- Built with Motion (Framer Motion) for buttery-smooth transitions
- Based on Lucide icon design system for consistency
- Easy integration via shadcn/ui CLI tooling
- TypeScript support out of the box
- Customizable animation parameters
- Community ports available for Svelte and Vue

## Quick Start Guide
1. Ensure you have a React project with shadcn/ui configured
2. Install icons using your package manager:
   ```bash
   pnpm dlx shadcn add @lucide-animated/{icon-name}
   ```
3. Import the animated icon component in your file
4. Use the component with optional animation props
5. Browse available icons at lucide-animated.com with `⌘F` search

## Use Cases
- Adding micro-interactions to buttons and CTAs
- Animated loading and status indicators
- Interactive navigation menus and sidebars
- Dashboard widgets with dynamic feedback
- Form validation visual feedback
- Notification and alert animations
- Theme toggle switches (sun/moon icons)

## Technical Details

## Notes & Considerations
This project originated as a practice exercise from the animations.dev course and has grown into a substantial community resource. The library is actively maintained (885+ commits) but noted as a work in progress. Icons follow Lucide's design language, so they pair well with existing Lucide icon usage. Components cannot be redistributed or resold as standalone products per the terms of use. For projects not using shadcn/ui, manual component integration may require additional setup.
