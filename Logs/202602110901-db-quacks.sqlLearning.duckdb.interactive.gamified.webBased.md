# DB Quacks - Interactive SQL & DuckDB Tutorial

## Overview

DB Quacks is a gamified, browser-based SQL learning platform powered by DuckDB. It presents SQL lessons as a quest game where learners progress through interactive challenges to build their SQL skills. The platform runs entirely in the browser using DuckDB-WASM, meaning no server-side execution is needed — queries run locally in your browser.

## Core Features

- **Quest-based learning** — structured as a game with progressive challenges rather than dry tutorials
- **Powered by DuckDB** — uses DuckDB-WASM for in-browser SQL execution with real query feedback
- **Interactive tutorials** — write and run SQL queries directly in the browser
- **No setup required** — fully web-based, no database installation or configuration needed
- **Instant feedback** — see query results immediately as you learn
- **Learn modern SQL** — DuckDB supports modern SQL features and analytical functions

## Notes & Considerations

The site is JavaScript-rendered (SPA), so traditional web scrapers won't extract content. DuckDB is an excellent choice for in-browser SQL learning because it's fast, supports standard SQL plus analytical extensions, and compiles to WebAssembly efficiently. Good alternative to setting up PostgreSQL or SQLite locally for learning purposes. The gamified "quest" approach may help maintain engagement compared to traditional documentation-style tutorials.
