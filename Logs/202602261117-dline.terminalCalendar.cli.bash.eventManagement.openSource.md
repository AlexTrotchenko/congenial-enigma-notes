# dLine - Terminal Calendar for Developers

## Overview

dLine is a command-line calendar tool that brings scheduling directly to your terminal. Track important dates, add events quickly, calculate workday spans, manage multiple calendars, and get popup reminders — all without leaving the terminal. Features Google Calendar integration, public holiday imports via OpenHolidays API, and color-coded categories.

## Core Features

- **Dynamic view** — current month with past dates shaded, future events highlighted, color-coded categories
- **Static view** — simple monthly calendar for any month (`dline -m yyyy/mm`)
- **Event calculator** — count workdays between dates with weekend/weekday breakdown
- **Multiple calendars** — switch between different calendar datasets
- **Category filtering** — show/hide event types (deadlines, work, personal, holidays, etc.)
- **Deadline countdown** — background process monitors upcoming deadlines (6 months ahead)
- **Popup reminders** — events with times trigger system notifications via `at` command
- **Google Calendar sync** — import events via gcalcli integration
- **Public holidays** — auto-import regional holidays from OpenHolidays API
- **School holidays toggle** — show as days off (students) or work days (parents)

## Event Categories

| Code | Category |
|------|----------|
| 1 | Deadline |
| 2 | Work |
| 3 | Personal |
| 4 | Birthday & Anniversary |
| 5 | Public Holiday |
| 6 | Vacation |
| 7 | Sick Leave |
| 8 | School Holiday |

## Quick Start Guide

**Dependencies:**
```bash
# Required
apt install at jq  # or brew install at jq

# Optional (recommended)
brew install gcalcli fzf
```

**Basic Usage:**
```bash
dline                    # Show current month (dynamic view)
dline -a                 # Add event (interactive)
dline -a 2024/07/04 3 "Buy milk"  # Add event directly
dline -m 2024/10         # Static monthly view
dline -w 2024/01/01 2024/12/31   # Calculate workdays
dline -f 4 6 8           # Filter categories
dline -i GCA             # Import from Google Calendar
```

**Common Commands:**
```bash
dline -b       # Manage calendar datasets (backup, switch, etc.)
dline -d "#projectX"   # Delete events with hashtag
dline -c       # Clean old entries
dline -k       # Kill pending reminders
dline -o       # Open data file in terminal editor
```

## Use Cases

- **Developer scheduling** — quick terminal access to your calendar
- **Freelancer billing** — calculate workdays for quotes (`dline -w`)
- **Project tracking** — tag events with hashtags (#projectX), filter/delete by tag
- **Deadline management** — automatic countdown and reminders
- **Multi-calendar** — separate work/personal calendars, switch easily
- **Offline calendar** — local data with optional Google Calendar sync

## Technical Details

- **Pricing Model:** Free and open-source
- **Platform Support:** Linux, macOS (requires Bash 4.0+)
- **Dependencies:** `at` (scheduling), `jq` (JSON parsing)
- **Optional:** gcalcli (Google Calendar), fzf (fuzzy filtering), Nerd Font (icons)
- **Config Files:** `.dlinerc` (system-wide), `settings.json` (calendar-specific)
- **Data:** `events_data.txt` (or prefixed files for multiple calendars)

## Notes & Considerations

⚠️ **macOS users:** Default Bash is 3.x — install Bash 4.0+ via `brew install bash`. The dynamic view runs autonomous background processes monitoring deadlines and triggering reminders. Reminders persist across reboots via the `at` command. First launch prompts for your region to fetch relevant holidays. If OpenHolidays API doesn't support your country, you can import holidays from a Google Calendar instead. Hashtags in event descriptions (#projectX) enable easy filtering and batch operations.
