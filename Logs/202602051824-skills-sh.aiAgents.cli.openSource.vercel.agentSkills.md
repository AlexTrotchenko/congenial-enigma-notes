# Skills.sh - The Open Agent Skills Ecosystem

## Overview

Skills.sh is Vercel's open-source tool that provides AI agents with a standardized way to execute reusable actions through the command line. It acts as a lightweight runtime where agents can call shell-based skills with defined inputs, outputs, and execution behavior. The goal is to separate agent reasoning from execution by giving agents access to controlled, predefined commands instead of relying on dynamically generated shell logic — essentially "npm for AI agents."

## Core Features

- **Standardized skill execution** — each skill follows a simple contract defining inputs, outputs, and execution behavior
- **Shell-based commands** — skills run as CLI commands, making them predictable and auditable
- **Open ecosystem** — developers can publish, share, and discover skills through the skills.sh directory
- **Local and CI-compatible** — works on developer machines and in automated pipelines consistently
- **Simple configuration** — skills are defined via config files without heavy frameworks or dependencies
- **Versioned and explicit** — teams can understand and review exactly what actions an agent is allowed to take
- **Skills leaderboard** — discover popular skills ranked by install count

## Quick Start Guide

1. Install a skill with npx:
   ```bash
   npx skills add <owner/repo>
   ```
2. Skills are now available for your AI agents to invoke
3. Browse available skills at [skills.sh](https://skills.sh)
4. Create your own skills using the configuration format in the [docs](https://skills.sh/docs)
5. Publish to share with the community

## Use Cases

- **Agent execution reliability** — solve the "what can you do?" problem with discoverable skills
- **File and project operations** — reading/modifying files, running build steps, querying project metadata
- **API interactions** — controlled access to external services through predefined skills
- **CI/CD automation** — integrate agent skills into pipelines for consistent behavior
- **Team collaboration** — share common agent actions across projects with versioned skills
- **Agent capability discovery** — make agent abilities explicit and browsable

## Technical Details

- **Pricing Model:** Free and open-source
- **Platform Support:** Any platform with Node.js/npm (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- **Integration Options:** CLI-based, works with any agent framework; complements MCP (Model Context Protocol) for enterprise use cases
- **Data Export:** N/A — skills are configuration files and shell commands
- **Comparison:** Similar to LangChain tools, CrewAI tasks, and MCP, but shell-based rather than Python abstractions

## Notes & Considerations

Skills.sh focuses on composability and discoverability rather than protocol complexity. As one developer noted: "Skills solves 'how do devs share and discover agent capabilities' while MCP solves 'how do agents talk to tools.'" The two approaches are complementary — Skills for discovery, MCP for deterministic enterprise use cases. The project reportedly reached tens of thousands of installs shortly after launch. Many agent failures stem from unreliable execution rather than poor reasoning, and a skills layer helps address this gap.
