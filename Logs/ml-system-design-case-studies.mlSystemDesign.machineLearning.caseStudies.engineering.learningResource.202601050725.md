## Notes & Considerations
Repository is community-maintained and updated periodically (10 commits as of reference date). Some external links to original blog posts may become stale over time as companies reorganize their engineering blogs. Best used alongside other ML system design resources like Chip Huyen's book and Grokking the Machine Learning Interview. Case studies range from 2017-2023, with more recent entries focusing on LLM and generative AI applications. The repository creator also promotes HorizonX.live as a companion research tool with additional features like paper summaries and personalized libraries.
