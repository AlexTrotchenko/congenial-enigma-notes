# Agents Towards Production - End-to-End GenAI Agent Development Playbook

## Overview
Agents Towards Production is a comprehensive, open-source educational repository that delivers code-first tutorials covering every layer of production-grade GenAI agents. It provides proven patterns and reusable blueprints for building agents that scale from prototype to enterprise, with hands-on tutorials covering orchestration, memory, observability, deployment, security, and more. Each tutorial includes ready-to-run notebooks or code files, enabling developers to move from concept to working agent in minutes.

## Core Features
- **Complete Agent Architecture Coverage** - End-to-end tutorials covering stateful workflows, vector memory, real-time web search APIs, Docker deployment, FastAPI endpoints, and GPU scaling
- **Production-Ready Security** - Comprehensive security guardrails including prompt injection protection, hallucination blocking, and tool access control with real-time monitoring
- **Multi-Agent Coordination** - Tutorials on A2A protocol implementation for collaborative agent workflows and message exchange
- **Observability & Debugging** - Agent tracing, monitoring, evaluation, and automated testing frameworks (LangSmith, SteelThread)
- **Tool Integration Patterns** - Secure tool calling with OAuth2 authentication, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and integration with Gmail, Slack, Notion, and browser automation
- **RAG & Knowledge Management** - Production-grade RAG systems with intelligent indexing, document processing, and dual-memory architectures
- **Deployment Infrastructure** - Containerization with Docker, GPU deployment strategies, on-prem LLM deployment with Ollama, and API creation with FastAPI
- **Model Customization** - Fine-tuning guides for domain expertise, efficiency optimization, and specialized agent behavior

## Quick Start Guide
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/NirDiamant/agents-towards-production.git`
2. Navigate to the repository: `cd agents-towards-production`
3. Browse tutorials organized by category (Tool Integration, Full-Stack Applications, Data Processing, Memory Systems, etc.)
4. Select a tutorial folder and install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run interactive notebooks: `jupyter notebook tutorial.ipynb` or execute scripts: `python app.py`
6. Adapt proven patterns directly into your agent development workflow

## Use Cases
- Building production-ready GenAI agents from scratch with best practices
- Learning enterprise-scale agent architecture and deployment patterns
- Implementing secure tool calling and authentication workflows for agents
- Creating stateful agents with persistent memory and semantic search
- Deploying agents as scalable APIs with observability and monitoring
- Integrating real-time web data and browser automation into agent workflows
- Implementing multi-agent coordination and communication protocols
- Fine-tuning models for specialized domain expertise and cost efficiency

## Technical Details
- **Pricing Model**: Completely free and open-source under custom non-commercial license
- **Platform Support**: Platform-agnostic Python code, runs on Linux, macOS, Windows; tutorials use Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts
- **Integration Options**: Covers integrations with LangGraph, LangSmith, FastAPI, Docker, Ollama, Portia, Arcade, Bright Data, Tavily, Runpod, and more
- **Data Export**: All code is portable and customizable; includes patterns for various deployment targets
