# Tech Interview Handbook - Curated Technical Interview Preparation Materials

## Overview
Tech Interview Handbook is a comprehensive, free resource providing curated coding interview preparation materials for software engineers. Created by the author of the popular Blind 75 list, it covers the entire interview process from resume preparation to offer negotiation, with over 1,000,000 engineers having benefited from these materials.

## Core Features
- Grind 75 - evolved version of Blind 75 with curated LeetCode questions organized by pattern

## Notes & Considerations
Content is condensed and practical rather than comprehensive - designed for busy engineers who need efficient preparation. System design content is still being developed; the handbook recommends ByteByteGo or Design Gurus courses for system design prep. Front-end specific content has been moved to a separate Front End Interview Handbook. The repository welcomes community contributions for additional domains and content areas.
