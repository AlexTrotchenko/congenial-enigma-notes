## Notes & Considerations
This is a curated list/directory rather than installable software itself. Software entries vary widely in maturity, maintenance status, and complexity. Always verify current status of any project before deployment as some may become unmaintained. The list focuses on Free Software (FOSS); proprietary/non-free options are segregated to a separate document. Entries marked with ⚠ indicate anti-features such as requiring external services or having other caveats. With 258k+ GitHub stars, this is one of the most trusted resources in the self-hosting community.
